# ProtripBook

## Description
ProtripBook is a logbook of all your professional displacement.
It helps professionals who need to provide a ratio of professional/private usage of their car.

For every professional displacement, provide the starting and ending location, then let the app
calculate the travelled distance. Keep the odometer updated and see the statistics over the
selected time period.
ProtripBook allows you to extract your displacement listing as a report file to Google Drive.
